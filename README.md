# ![XSX-Logo](doc/xsx-logo.png?raw=true) – eXtended S-eXpressions

Package XSX provides tools for parsing something I call eXtended S-eXpressions.
Extended means the following things:

1. Nested structures are delimited by balanced braces '()', '[]' or '{}’ – not only by '()'.
2. XSX provides a notation for "Meta Values", i.e. XSXs that provide some sort of meta information that is not part of the "normal" data.

## Rationale
None! … despite the fact that I found it to be fun – and useful in some situations
