// Package XSX provides tools for parsing so called eXtended S-eXpressions.
// Extended means the following things:
//
// Nested structures are delimited by balanced braces '()', '[]' or '{}’ – not
// only by '()'.
//
// XSX provides a notation for "Meta Values", i.e. XSX that provide some sort
// of meta information that is not part of the "normal" data.
